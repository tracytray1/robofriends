# RoboFriends: A React Robot Directory

This project is a simple, interactive robot directory built with React. It utilizes RoboHash for robot avatars and fetches user data from a public API to display information about each robot.  A dynamic search feature allows users to filter the robot list based on name.

## Features

* **Robot Avatars:**  Robot avatars are dynamically generated using RoboHash based on user IDs.
* **User Data:** User data (name, email) is fetched from the JSONPlaceholder API (`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`).
* **React-based:** Built using React for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
* **Dynamic Search:**  Filter the robot list in real-time by typing in the search bar.

## Technologies Used

* **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **RoboHash:** Service for generating robot avatars.
* **JSONPlaceholder:**  Fake API for testing and prototyping.  Specifically used here to retrieve user data.
